   <p>
       <ul>
           <li>2 and 3/4 cups (344g) all-purpose flour (spoon & leveled)
            </li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar</li>
              <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>  
               <li>2 and 1/4 teaspoons Red Star Platinum Yeast or any instant yeast (1 packet)</li> 
               <li>1/2 cup (120ml) whole milk</li> 
               <li>1/4 cup (60ml) water</li> 
               <li> 3 Tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
               <li>1 large egg</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Filling: </h2>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Tablespoons (45g) unsalted butter, softened to room temperature</li>
            <li>1 Tablespoon ground cinnamon</li>
            <li>1/4 cup (50g) granulated sugar or packed light or dark brown sugar</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Icing:</h2>
<p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (120g) confectioners’ sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon pure vanilla extract</li>
        <li>2–3 Tablespoons (30-45ml) strong brewed coffee or milk</li>
    </ul>

</p>
<h2>Instructions:</h2>
<p>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the dough: Whisk the flour, sugar, salt, and yeast together in a large bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Combine the milk, water, and butter together in a heatproof bowl. Microwave or use the stove and heat until the butter is melted and the mixture is warm to touch (about 110°F). Pour into the dry ingredients, add the egg, and stir until it forms a soft dough or use your mixer.</li>
        <li>On a lightly floured surface using floured hands, knead the dough for 3 minutes. Place in a lightly greased bowl (I use non-stick spray), cover loosely, and let rest for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Fill the rolls: After 10 minutes, roll the dough out in a 14×8 inch rectangle. Spread the softened butter on top. Mix together the cinnamon and sugar. Sprinkle it all over the dough. Roll up the dough tightly to make a 14 inch log. Cut into 10-12 even rolls and arrange in a lightly greased 9-inch round cake pan or pie dish.</li>
        <li>Rise: Tightly cover the rolls with aluminum foil or plastic wrap and allow to rise in a warm, draft-free environment for 60-90 minutes. See blog post above for my trick to this step!</li>
        <li>Bake the rolls: After the rolls have doubled in size, preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C). Bake for 25-28 minutes until lightly browned. If you notice the tops are getting too brown too quickly, loosely cover the rolls with aluminum foil and continue baking.
        </li>
        <li>Make the icing: Whisk the confectioners’ sugar, vanilla extract, and coffee/milk together. Drizzle or spread over warm rolls.</li>
        <li>Cover leftover frosted or unfrosted rolls tightly and store for up to 3 days at room temperature or up to 5 days in the refrigerator.</li>
    </ul>
